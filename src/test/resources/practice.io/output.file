PARIS! IN PARIS IT WAS, IN THE SUMMER OF 1840. THERE I FIRST MET THAT STRANGE AND INTERESTING YOUNG FELLOW, AUGUST DUPIN.DUPIN WAS THE LAST MEMBER OF A WELL-KNOWN FAMILY, A FAMILY WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN RICH AND FAMOUS; HE HIMSELF, HOWEVER,WAS FAR FROM RICH. HE CARED LITTLE ABOUT MONEY. HE HAD ENOUGH TO BUY THE MOST NECESSARY THINGS OF LIFE â€” AND A FEW BOOKS;HE DID NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF ABOUT THE REST. JUST BOOKS. WITH BOOKS HE WAS HAPPY. WE FIRST MET WHEN WE WERE BOTH TRYINGTO FIND THE SAME BOOK. AS IT WAS A BOOK WHICH FEW HAD EVER HEARD OF, THIS CHANCE BROUGHT US TOGETHER IN AN OLD BOOKSTORE.LATER WE MET AGAIN IN THE SAME STORE. THEN AGAIN IN ANOTHER BOOKSTORE. SOON WE BEGAN TO TALK. I WAS DEEPLY INTERESTEDIN THE FAMILY HISTORY HE TOLD ME.. I WAS SURPRISED, TOO, AT HOW MUCH AND HOW WIDELY HE HAD READ; MORE IMPORTANT, THEFORCE OF HIS BUSY MIND WAS LIKE A BRIGHT LIGHT IN MY SOUL. I FELT THAT THE FRIENDSHIP OF SUCH A MAN WOULD BE FOR MERICHES WITHOUT PRICE.
